### Abstract:
We present a comprehensive investigation
into the problem of automatically generating timestamps for videos. To address
this challenge, we propose and evaluate
two different automatic pipelines for
timestamp generation. Our first approach
combines automatic speech recognition
with state-of-the-art language models to
generate suggestions for timestamps. The
results of our study demonstrate that our
pipeline generates adequate keywords
for the video but the timing of the times-
tamps remains a challenge. Overall, our
study offers a promising approach for
automatically generating timestamps for
videos, and in particular it highlights the
potential for further work in this area.
